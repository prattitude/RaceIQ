# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents working in this repository.


## Project Overview

RaceIQ is a full-stack racing telemetry analysis app for Forza Motorsport 2023, F1 25, Assetto Corsa, Assetto Corsa Competizione, Assetto Corsa Evo, iRacing, and Le Mans Ultimate. UDP and native Windows telemetry sources feed a Bun server, SQLite storage, and a React dashboard. See [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md).

## Codebase Discovery

When available, try the DeepWiki MCP first (`read_wiki_structure`,
`read_wiki_contents`, or `ask_question`) to learn the app's architecture and
feature flows before broad code searches. Use DeepWiki for orientation, then
verify implementation details against the current checkout because its content
may be stale or unavailable. Fall back to repository search when needed.

## Completion Verification

Always run `bun run typecheck` before handing work back to user as complete.

## Commands

```bash
# Development (starts both server and client)
bun run dev

# Server only (Bun with --watch, port 3117)
bun run dev:server

# Client only (Vite with portless)
bun run dev:client

# Tests (Bun test runner)
bun run test                        # use bun run test, not bun test (sets --timeout 60000)
bun test --timeout 60000 test/parser.test.ts   # single test file

# Database
bun run db:seed              # populate DATA_DIR with committed real-lap demo data
bun run db:seed --clean      # delete all rows/files, preserve schema, then reseed
bun run db:seed --reset      # remove only seeded rows and regenerate demo data
bun run db:seed --games fm-2023,acc,ac-evo,iracing
bun run db:seed --force      # explicitly allow seeding alongside existing user data
bun run db:push       # sync Drizzle schema to SQLite (dev introspection only — see note below)
bun run db:generate   # generate Drizzle migration files (not used at runtime — see note below)

# Production build (client bundle + compiled server binary → dist/)
bun run build

# Run production build
bun run start

# Build Windows installer
bun run build:installer

# Client-specific
cd client && bun run build   # production build (tsc + vite)
cd client && bun run lint    # Oxlint

# Dump mode (develop without a running game — captures raw packets)
bun run dev:dump:fm            # dump Forza Motorsport packets
bun run dev:dump:f1            # dump F1 2025 packets
bun run dev:dump:acc           # dump ACC packets

# AI development (Mastra agent playground)
bun run mastra:studio          # Studio UI (localhost:3000) reading the running dev server's in-process Mastra API (:3117)

# Utility scripts
bun run laps:export            # export lap data
bun run laps:import            # import lap data
bun run lighthouse             # run Lighthouse audit on local dev server
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SERVER_PORT` | `3117` | HTTP/WebSocket server port |
| `UDP_PORT` | `5301` | Game telemetry UDP listen port |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Database and settings directory |

### Development Onboarding Flag

Pass `--onboarding false` to the full development command to skip the Setup
Wizard and open any RaceIQ page directly:

```bash
bun run dev --onboarding false
```

Use `--onboarding true` to force the Setup Wizard, or omit the flag to use the
persisted onboarding state normally. The server-side override is development
only and does not change `settings.json`; production builds ignore the flag.

## Architecture

### Three-layer monorepo: `server/`, `client/`, `shared/`

**Server (Bun + Hono)**
- `server/index.ts` — Thin executable entry; `server/runtime/boot.ts` owns ordered startup
- `server/runtime/udp-listener.ts` — UDP socket listening for game telemetry packets
- `server/games/` — Game-owned parsers/adapters plus generic packet dispatch — see [Adding a New Game](#adding-a-new-game)
- `server/routes/index.ts` — Hono app composition; bounded route groups live in `server/routes/`
- `server/runtime/websocket-manager.ts` — WebSocket manager, 30Hz throttled broadcast to all connected clients
- `server/telemetry/live-pipeline.ts` — Telemetry processing pipeline (normalize → suspension fill → lap detect → sector track → pit track → track calibration → broadcast)
- `server/lap-detection/detector.ts` — Detects lap boundaries from telemetry stream (per-game factory via adapter)
- `server/live-strategy/` — Live sector timing and pit/fuel/tire estimates
- `server/lap-analysis/corners.ts` — Game-aware racing-corner identification
- `server/ai/` — AI analysis system (see [AI Analysis System](#ai-analysis-system))
- `server/db/schema.ts` — Drizzle ORM schema (profiles, sessions, laps, corners, lapAnalyses, compareAnalyses, trackOutlines)
- `server/db/*-queries.ts` — Responsibility-scoped database query modules
- `server/db/migrations.ts` — Hand-rolled migration list (SQL array, version-tracked)
- `server/db/index.ts` — Runs migrations on startup via custom runner
- `server/runtime/platform/tray.ts` — System tray integration (Windows)
- `server/runtime/update/check.ts` — Auto-update checker

### Database migration approach

Drizzle is used **only as a query builder and type-safe schema reference** — NOT for runtime migrations. Schema changes are managed via a hand-rolled migration system in `server/db/migrations.ts`. The app compiles to a self-contained Windows binary (`raceiq.exe`); Drizzle's `migrate()` reads SQL files from disk at runtime, which would break single-binary distribution. The custom system embeds all migration SQL directly in the compiled binary.

**To add a schema change:**
1. Edit `server/db/schema.ts` (keeps Drizzle types in sync)
2. Add a new entry at the bottom of `server/db/migrations.ts` with the next version number and the raw SQL
3. Do NOT use `bun run db:push` to apply schema changes — it is for dev introspection only and must never drop `schema_migrations` (protected via `tablesFilter` in `drizzle.config.ts`)
4. NEVER edit historical migrations already released. Append a new migration with the next version; editing old migrations breaks production databases.

### Pipeline dependency injection

The pipeline uses `DbAdapter` and `WsAdapter` interfaces for testability:
- Production: `RealDbAdapter` (SQLite), plus a module-level `WsAdapter` delegating to `wsManager`
- Tests: `NullDbAdapter`/`NullWsAdapter` (no-op) or `CapturingDbAdapter`/`CapturingWsAdapter` (record calls)

### AI Analysis System

The AI system uses Mastra agents backed by configured Gemini, OpenAI, or local-compatible providers with streaming and prompt caching.

**Agents** (`server/ai/agents.ts`):
- Lap Analyst — single-lap breakdown with corner-by-corner analysis
- Compare Engineer — head-to-head lap comparison (inputs-focused)
- Chat Agent — interactive Q&A about laps and comparisons
- Race Engineer (`mastra/agents/setup-engineer.ts`, id `setup-engineer`) — owns the CAR in an experiment; the only agent with `apply_changes`
- Driver Coach (`mastra/agents/driver-coach.ts`, id `driver-coach`) — owns the DRIVER in an experiment; the only agent with `record_drill`

The experiment chat picks between the last two by `experiments.focus` via
`sessionAgentForFocus()` — a switch over a column the driver set, not a
coordinator agent inferring a route. Both share one session thread
(`tune-session-<id>`) so switching focus mid-conversation keeps its history,
and neither can do the other's job because the tool is simply not on it.
There is deliberately no agent-to-agent consult: handover is the driver
flipping focus. See [Experiment focus](#experiment-focus).

**Prompt files** (`server/ai/`): `analyst-prompt.ts`, `chat-prompt.ts`, `compare-engineer.ts`, `compare-chat-prompt.ts`, `inputs-compare-prompt.ts`, `corner-data.ts`, `format-tune.ts`

**Mastra directory** (`mastra/`): Agent definitions + the `mastra` instance (LibSQL default store + DuckDB observability). In dev it is mounted **in-process** onto the RaceIQ Hono app under `/studio-api` (see `server/runtime/dev-studio.ts`), so the server is the sole DuckDB writer and `bun run mastra:studio` reads its real traces over HTTP — no second `mastra dev` process, no DuckDB file lock. Excluded from the prod binary via `NODE_ENV` gating.

### Experiment focus

An experiment has a **focus** — what it is currently varying — and the driver
switches it mid-session from the workspace header (fix the balance, then work
on braking, same experiment).

| Level | Column / field | Values | Mutable? |
|-------|----------------|--------|----------|
| Experiment mode | `experiments.focus` | `car` \| `driver` | **Yes** — switchable any time |
| Arm | `experiment_versions.kind` | `setup` \| `drill` | No — fixed at creation |
| One change inside an arm | `TestChange.kind` (`shared/types.ts`) | `setup` \| `drill` | No |

⚠️ **The three levels deliberately do NOT share a vocabulary.** Keep mode as
`car`/`driver`; source of truth is `shared/experiment-focus.ts`
(`versionKindForFocus`, `focusForVersionKind`, `headlineMetricForVersionKind`).

**Focus decides the NEXT arm; it never rewrites arms already recorded.**
Switching to `driver` does not turn prior versions into drills. Each arm is
judged on its own metric: setup arm → best lap, drill → lap-time spread.

**Focus ledger** — every switch is appended to `experiment_focus_events`
(append-only; a no-op re-select writes nothing) with `from_version_id`, the head
at the moment of the switch, so the version tree can mark where each era began.
Surfaced by `FocusTimeline` in the History panel and an era badge in
`VersionGraph`.

Migrations: **v39** adds the column + ledger, **v40** normalises databases that
ran v39 before the `car`/`driver` rename.

**Caching**: Analysis results cached in DB (`lapAnalyses` for single laps, `compareAnalyses` for lap pairs with a `kind` discriminator).

**Client (React 19 + Vite + TanStack Router)**
- `client/src/main.tsx` — App entry point
- `client/src/routes/__root.tsx` — Root layout with TanStack Router
- `client/src/routeTree.gen.ts` — Auto-generated route tree (do not edit manually)
- `client/src/stores/telemetry.ts` — Zustand store for WebSocket connection state, current packet, packets/sec, live history arrays
- `client/src/stores/game.ts` — Zustand store for active game context (gameId → route mapping)
- `client/src/stores/ui.ts` — Zustand store for UI state (settings modal, onboarding)
- Key components:
  - `LiveTelemetry.tsx` — Real-time telemetry dashboard
  - `LapAnalyse.tsx` — Lap analysis with corner data
  - `LapComparison.tsx` — Side-by-side lap comparison
  - `TrackMap.tsx` — Track visualization
  - `TelemetryChart.tsx` — Data charting (uplot)
  - `BodyAttitude.tsx` — 3D car orientation (Three.js / React Three Fiber)
  - `AiAnalysisModal.tsx` — AI-powered analysis using configured AI provider
  - `Settings.tsx` — App settings modal (UDP port, units)
  - `TuneCatalog.tsx` — Vehicle setup tuning

**Shared (`shared/`)**
- `shared/types.ts` — Telemetry packet types, enums, shared interfaces
- `shared/games/` — Game adapter registry and per-game adapters — see [Adding a New Game](#adding-a-new-game)
- `shared/car-data.ts` — Car model ID-to-name mapping (dispatches via game adapter)
- `shared/tracks/` — Track metadata, geometry, guides, and verification data
- `shared/tunes/` — Vehicle setup data (JSON)

### Data Flow

1. Game sends UDP packets → `server/runtime/udp-listener.ts` receives and buffers
2. `server/games/packet-dispatch.ts` auto-detects game via `canHandle()`, then its game-owned parser decodes binary → typed telemetry object
3. `server/lap-detection/detector.ts` tracks lap boundaries, saves completed laps to SQLite
4. `server/runtime/websocket-manager.ts` broadcasts live packet to all WebSocket clients
5. Client `telemetry.ts` Zustand store receives via WebSocket → React components re-render
6. Historical data fetched via REST API (`/api/laps`, `/api/sessions`, etc.)

### Key Conventions

- Path aliases: `@shared/*` → `./shared/*` (server/test), `@/*` → `./src/*` (client only)
- Client proxies `/api` and `/ws` requests to `localhost:3117` via Vite dev server config
- **API calls use Hono RPC**: import `client` from `@/lib/rpc.ts` (typed against `AppType` from `server/routes/index.ts`) — do not use raw `fetch` for API routes
- **gameId travels via `X-Game-Id` header** — not query params or effect-populated stores
- **Telemetry semantics preserve native channels one-to-one.** Never alias, average, merge, or relabel game output into a different physical concept; use `unavailable` when source lacks a semantic. Consumer projections stay explicit. Follow [telemetry semantic rules](docs/reference/semantics.md).
- Database file: `<DATA_DIR>/app.db` (SQLite)
- Settings persisted to: `data/settings.json`
- UI components use shadcn (in `client/src/components/ui/`) with Tailwind CSS v4
- **Translations:** all user-facing client copy must use Paraglide messages from `client/messages/`; add or update every supported locale before using new text.
- Client uses TanStack React Query for server state management
- 3D visualizations use React Three Fiber (Three.js wrapper for React)
- **Never fall back to "fm-2023"** when gameId is missing — make gameId required
**Release-note wording**

- Write `Features`, `Breaking`, and `Fixes` for customers. Use plain, concise wording that tells users what changed and how it affects them; avoid internal terminology and implementation details.
- Name the product surface when useful, and describe outcomes at the level users recognize.
- For breaking changes, state what users must do or what no longer works.
- Use one user-visible change per bullet. Lead with outcome and avoid vague verbs such as `improve`, `enhance`, or `handle`.
- Keep `Internal` for non-user-facing work; technical detail and implementation context are acceptable there.
- Keep section categories accurate. Do not claim behavior broader than shipped.
- Preserve `### Fixes` and `### Internal` headings in `## Unreleased`, even when empty.
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT — NO DYNAMIC IMPORTS.** `await import(...)` is **banned** in this repo. Static imports at the top of the file, always. The *only* exception is a literal platform-specific switch (e.g. a Windows-only native module guarded by `process.platform === "win32"`) where the target genuinely doesn't exist on other platforms — and even then, document the reason inline. "Lazy-load to avoid startup cost", "break a circular dep", or "match the pattern in this file" are **NOT** valid reasons — fix the architecture instead. This rule has repeatedly caused test hangs (234s `isNewer` case) and opaque module-load chains; it is non-negotiable.

### Branch and PR targeting

- If user names an existing PR, work only on that PR's head branch.
- Before committing or pushing, inspect current branch and target PR head.
- Do not create a new branch or PR when target PR exists.
- Push changes to target PR head branch; update its description in place.
- If checkout branch differs from target head, switch to target head before editing.
- Never force-push target PR branch unless user explicitly requests it.

### Pull request descriptions

- Describe the original user problem and the outcome in concise, easy-to-understand Markdown bullets. Include relevant benchmark results when available; never invent results.
- Do not list changed files or implementation-only file inventories.
- When editing PR descriptions with `gh pr edit`, preserve Markdown formatting. Do not pass `\n` inside ordinary quoted shell arguments; shell may keep it as literal text. Use a heredoc/body file or shell quoting that creates real line breaks.
- Verify the saved description with `gh pr view --json body` and confirm paragraphs and bullets contain actual line breaks before reporting completion.

### Dependency inspection

- Do not read, search, or inspect `node_modules/` source files. Treat installed dependencies as opaque; use repository code, package manifests, lockfiles, and official upstream documentation when dependency behavior matters.

### Custom Steering Wheels

The steering wheel displayed during live telemetry is file-driven. To add a custom wheel:

1. Place an image in `client/public/wheels/`
2. Supported formats: `.svg`, `.webp`, `.png`, `.jpg`
3. The filename (minus extension) becomes the display name

Example: `client/public/wheels/Logitech G Pro.png` → shows as "Logitech G Pro"

The wheel picker in Settings and Setup Wizard automatically discovers all images in that directory.

### Game Adapter System

The app uses a registry-based adapter pattern to support multiple racing games. Each game provides a `GameAdapter` (shared) and `ServerGameAdapter` (server-only) that encapsulate all game-specific behavior.

**Shared adapter** (`shared/games/types.ts` — `GameAdapter`):
- Identity: `id`, `displayName`, `shortName`, `routePrefix`
- Car/track resolution: `getCarName()`, `getTrackName()`, `getSharedTrackName()`
- Steering config: `steeringCenter`, `steeringRange` (used by corner detection)
- Coordinate system: `coordSystem` (used by track maps)
- Optional metadata: `carClassNames`, `drivetrainNames`

**Server adapter** (`server/games/types.ts` — `ServerGameAdapter`):
- Packet detection: `canHandle(buf)` — quick check if a UDP buffer belongs to this game
- Parsing: `tryParse(buf, state)` — parse buffer into `TelemetryPacket`
- Parser state: `createParserState()` — e.g. F1's multi-packet accumulator (null if stateless)
- AI analysis: `aiSystemPrompt`, `buildAiContext(packets)`

**Registries:**
- `shared/games/registry.ts` — `registerGame()`, `getGame()`, `tryGetGame()`, `getAllGames()`
- `server/games/registry.ts` — `registerServerGame()`, `getServerGame()`, `getAllServerGames()`

**Current adapters:**
- `shared/games/fm-2023/` + `server/games/fm-2023/` — Forza Motorsport 2023
- `shared/games/f1-2025/` + `server/games/f1-2025/` — F1 25
- `shared/games/acc/` + `server/games/acc/` — Assetto Corsa Competizione
- `shared/games/ac-evo/` + `server/games/ac-evo/` — Assetto Corsa Evo
- `shared/games/iracing/` + `server/games/iracing/` — iRacing
- `shared/games/ac/` + `server/games/ac/` — original Assetto Corsa (v1.7 shared memory)

Follow the registry and boundary model in [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md). Implement shared and server adapters, register both, then add game-specific parsing, routes, data, and focused tests. Never introduce an implicit fallback game.

### Track Segments: curated geometry is the source of truth

⚠️ **`shared/track-segment-generate.ts` (`bun run tracks:segments`) is a FALLBACK detector, not a ground truth.** It infers corner regions from a centerline polyline so that a track with no curated geometry still gets usable segments. It will never be 100% accurate, and that is by design.

The hierarchy:

1. **Curated geometry** (`shared/tracks/<gameId>/<slug>-segments.json` — per-game `segments` + `sectors`) — authoritative.
2. **Curated facts / roster** (`shared/tracks/meta/<slug>.json` — corner numbers, names, `direction`, `group`) — authoritative.
3. **Detection** (`detectCornerRegions`) — best-effort. Only fills gaps; must never overwrite curated data.

**Therefore: a detector miss on a track that already ships curated geometry costs nothing.** Do not loosen detection thresholds or reshape shared rosters around one game's centerline. Fix curated data when a shipped track looks wrong; touch generator only for general bugs affecting every track.

The sanctioned-gap ledgers in `test/helpers/track-known-gaps.ts` (`KNOWN_ALIGNMENT_GAPS`, `KNOWN_FUZZY_ALIGNMENTS`, `KNOWN_TURN_GAPS`) record accepted centerline misses. They are **shrink-only**: each entry is asserted to remain broken, so a fix forces deletion.

#### Curation coverage

Three separate claims, weakest to strongest:

| Column | Means |
|--------|-------|
| **Curated roster** | `shared/tracks/meta/<slug>.json` has a hand-authored non-empty `corners` array. |
| **Meta human-verified** | A person checked roster against a real turn-by-turn guide and signed it off. |
| **Segments human-verified** | A person checked game's rendered geometry and signed it off. Kept separate from meta because correct roster says nothing about corner placement. |

Counts live in `docs/contributing/track-curation.md`. Refresh after curation:

```bash
bun run tracks:coverage
bun run tracks:coverage --write
```

Signatures live in `shared/tracks/verified.json`; edits make signatures stale.
`test/track-coverage.test.ts` fails if committed table drifts from repo.

Full write-up: [track curation](docs/contributing/track-curation.md).

### Command and Script Reference Checks

When adding, removing, renaming, or changing a package command, script entry point, workflow invocation, or documented command:

1. Search repository references to old and new command/script names, including package manifests, workflows, shell wrappers, READMEs, and CI helper scripts.
2. Update every affected caller and documentation entry in the same change. Do not leave stale references or add a command without its documented execution path.
3. Run changed command or non-destructive validation path. For CI commands, execute equivalent local steps and verify failure propagation; `continue-on-error` must be followed by explicit failing gate when job must fail.
4. If command execution requires unavailable external services, run structural check proving command registration, referenced file existence, and expected exit status; report what remains unverified.

### Pre-commit Hooks (Lefthook)

Installed via `postinstall` script. Runs repository-wide checks before every commit:
- **lint** — `bun run lint`
- **typecheck** — `bun run typecheck`

Do not manually run the full `bun test` suite before pushing when these hooks pass; full tests run in CI. Run focused tests when validating changed behavior.

### Pull Request Creation

When creating or updating a pull request:

1. Review `git status` and the complete diff before opening or updating the PR.
2. Commit every change relevant to the PR, including tests, documentation, configuration, and changelog updates. Do not stop after committing only the initially requested file.
3. Check for related untracked and unstaged files, and include all relevant work in the PR commit.
4. Verify the PR branch has no relevant uncommitted or untracked changes before creating or updating the PR. Leave unrelated local work untouched and call it out explicitly.
5. Do not list files in the PR description. Describe behavior, motivation, risk, and verification instead.

### Pull Request Changelog

Classify each change before editing `CHANGELOG.md`:
- **Customer-facing behavior** — add concise user-facing bullet under `## Unreleased` in `### Breaking`, `### Features`, or `### Fixes`.
- **Internal-only CI, tooling, maintenance, tests, or developer workflow** — add concise note under `## Unreleased` → `### Internal`, not under customer-facing sections.

Never put internal mechanics in customer-facing release notes. Run `bun test test/changelog.test.ts --timeout 60000` only when changing `CHANGELOG.md`.

### AI Evaluators

Lap Analyst and Compare Engineer outputs are gated by deterministic scorers under `mastra/evals/scorers/`. The eval harness runs real fixture laps through an eval-only agent (pinned to `google/gemini-3-flash`), scores the output, and fails the build if any score drops below its threshold in `mastra/evals/index.ts::SCORER_THRESHOLDS`.

**Scorers (all deterministic, no LLM judge):**
- `output-shape` — analyst output parses against `AnalystOutputSchema` (`server/ai/schemas.ts`). Threshold 1.0.
- `corner-coverage` — fraction of the fixture's expected slowest corners mentioned. Threshold 0.7.
- `numeric-grounding` — fraction of `tuning[]` entries citing a concrete number-with-unit. Threshold 0.8.
- `unit-consistency` — metric fixtures must not leak imperial units, and vice versa. Threshold 1.0.
- `compare-directionality` — compare output correctly names the faster lap. Threshold 0.9.
- `chat-freeform-shape` — chat output is non-empty, cites real corners, no hallucinated corner names. Threshold 0.8.
- `drill-quality` — a Driver Coach drill is LOCATED (0.3), ACTIONABLE (0.3), SINGULAR (0.3), and CONCRETE (0.1). Threshold 0.75.

**Schema source of truth:** every game adapter prompt (FM, F1, ACC, AC Evo) renders its JSON output shape via `renderAnalystSchemaForPrompt()` from `server/ai/schemas.ts`, so the scorer and the model's instructions stay in lockstep. Per-game prompts still own their own category guidelines and domain rules, but the shape is centralised.

**Running evals:**
```
bun run test:ai                  # runs test/ai-quality.test.ts
bun run ai:baseline              # snapshots scores to test/ai-fixtures/baselines/<sha>-<model>.json
```

Both commands require `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`); they skip cleanly when absent so forks and fresh clones don't flake.

**Adding a fixture:** see `test/ai-fixtures/README.md`. In short: export a real lap via `bun run laps:export --ids <id> -o test/ai-fixtures/packets/<id>.zip`, then add a matching JSON under `test/ai-fixtures/laps/` with an `expected` block pinning _signals_ (corner names, faster lap, setup direction) — not a reference answer. Signals survive prompt iteration; reference answers do not.

**CI:** AI evals are local-dev only. Not gated in CI and not required before shipping.

### Testing

Tests live in `test/` and use Bun's native test runner (`bun:test` with `describe`/`test`/`expect`). Tests that involve packet parsing must initialize game adapters first:

```typescript
import { initGameAdapters } from "../shared/games/init";
import { initServerGameAdapters } from "../server/games/init";

initGameAdapters();
initServerGameAdapters();
```

**Known issue**: ACC shared memory tests fail on macOS due to `@libsql/client` module resolution (Windows-only feature).

### CI/CD
**Mars runner labels:** In GitHub Actions, a `runs-on` list of Mars labels is an OR selector. Use both the Windows and macOS labels when a job must be eligible for either platform; do not create a per-OS matrix unless the job must run once on each platform.
- **Cross-platform CI:** CI scripts and workflow commands must run on Windows and macOS. Prefer Bun/TypeScript and platform-neutral APIs over shell-specific syntax; when shell code is unavoidable, declare and test its shell explicitly.

- **PR/main**: GitHub Actions runs `bun test` and client build (`.github/workflows/build-test.yml`)
- **Release tags**: Windows x64 binary compilation via `.github/workflows/release.yml` — Bun compiles server to `raceiq.exe`, bundles with Vite client output into `raceiq-windows-x64.zip`


### Documentation

Use [docs landing page](docs/README.md) for maintained documentation, [architecture overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) for current service, adapter, and data-flow boundaries, and [track curation](docs/contributing/track-curation.md) before changing track metadata or segment geometry.
