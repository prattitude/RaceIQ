 *
 * Both games clear `is_valid_lap` the moment the car puts too many wheels off
 * the racing surface, and leave it cleared for the remainder of the lap. So a
 * true → false transition anywhere inside the lap is the cut, and a lap that is
 * already false at its first frame inherited the state from the previous lap
 * boundary rather than earning it here.
 *
 * A short run of false frames is ignored: the flag can flicker for a frame
 * across the start/finish line and during pit-lane transitions. Frames where
 * the flag is `null` (unknown — parser could not trust it, e.g. in the pits)
 * break a run rather than extending it.
 *
 * Returns null for non-Kunos packets, since no other game exposes this flag.
