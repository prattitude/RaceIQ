- Restored live-dashboard Storybook runtime context and added same-renderer local visual comparison before canonical Linux baseline generation
- Expanded visual regression coverage to 97 fixture-seeded responsive app states plus 17 Storybook states, covering every game, high-risk screens, track and experiment details, reusable primitives, navigation, dialogs, and viewport-positioned menus
- Added a local main-versus-worktree UI comparison report using the same responsive and Storybook screenshot inventory as pull-request previews
- Compare screenshot previews against each pull request's base branch and revision instead of current main
- Deterministic iRacing recording and replay coverage through the production parser pipeline
- Preserve complete iRacing SessionInfo YAML in recordings while keeping historical captures replayable and telemetry deltas compact
- Add fixture-seeded cross-game route and lap playback end-to-end coverage
- Completed fixture-seeded browser workflow coverage across Sessions, Analyse, Compare, Driver, Experiments, Chats, Tracks, Cars, Setups, Dash, developer tools, compiled binaries, and emulated devices

- Run versioned tuning and driving experiments in ACC and AC Evo, with setup changes, coaching drills, lap review, and car-or-driver focus
- Import MoTeC logs as normal sessions for analysis, comparison, and experiments
- Export and import individual laps or complete sessions as portable compressed captures
- View release history in Settings and see the installed version in the sidebar
- Move app navigation from the top bar into a left-hand sidebar, with a responsive mobile navigation drawer
- Copy AI Compare conversations as JSON and resume or regenerate analysis chats with complete persisted history
- Generate detailed, sector-aware lap-analysis results with consistent provider and settings handling
- Automatic driver profile metrics with optional, configurable background AI coaching and auditable run history
- Runtime-discovered iRacing cars and tracks, resolved by the SDK's native identifiers
- Support for iRacing's source-defined sector layouts, including two-sector ovals and layouts with more than three sectors
- View all release notes since your installed version in the app

### Fixes

- Keep unfinished game integrations and experiments out of production releases
- Make settings, onboarding, analysis, comparison, and experiment controls clearer and more consistent
- Show actionable guidance when AI provider, credentials, or model configuration is incomplete
- Keep chat drafts, submitted prompts, loading states, and conversation history consistent across AI surfaces
- Restore setup-seeded experiment branches and make branch deletion explicit
- Improve setup browsing with faster filters, clearer track and car context, and direct Forza tune access
- Keep analysis tables, tabs, maps, cards, and responsive layouts aligned across desktop and compact displays
- Improve session and sector tables when timing data is sparse or unavailable
- Show every registered game in storage settings, including games without recorded sessions
