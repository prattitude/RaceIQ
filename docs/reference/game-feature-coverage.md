# Game feature coverage

RaceIQ supports several games, but not every product surface or telemetry source is equivalent. This page records deliberate product and source gaps. It does not treat missing fixture evidence as an unsupported feature.

Canonical sources:

- `client/src/lib/game-routes.ts` owns navigation support for Driver, Experiments, Raw, and Setups. Shared Driver and Experiments routes enforce the same capability table.
- Global `/live` routes select the detected game's dashboard; `/live/pit` selects Pit Crew mode for Forza Motorsport and iRacing.
- `shared/games/*/index.ts` owns high-level telemetry and analysis capabilities.
- [Telemetry reference](telemetry.md) points to generated field-level coverage. Do not duplicate that matrix here.
- [End-to-end testing](../contributing/e2e-testing.md) records fixture and external-service limits separately.

## Product surfaces

`No` means RaceIQ intentionally withholds that route or workflow for the game. It does not mean the route is merely untested.

## Current game gaps

### Forza Motorsport 2023

- No Setup Engineer experiment workflow. Setup and tune browsing remains available.
- Three fantasy tracks intentionally have no curated corner roster because no real-world turn-by-turn guide exists. See [track curation](../contributing/track-curation.md).

### F1 2025

- Setup Engineer changes are advisory. RaceIQ cannot write them into the game.
- Surface-condition analysis is unavailable because the source does not provide the required channel.
- Track rosters are complete, but rendered segment placement is not yet human-verified.

### Assetto Corsa Competizione

- Surface-condition analysis is unavailable because the source does not provide the required channel.
- Some track centerlines still use preserved `fastlane.ai` racing-line geometry until their boundary-derived centerlines and corner rosters are re-curated. This is tracked by the shrink-only gap register described in [track curation](../contributing/track-curation.md).
- Per-car setup range curation remains incomplete. See [per-car setup ranges](../project-status/per-car-setup-ranges.md).

### Assetto Corsa Evo

- Native setup inspection is unavailable.
- Some centerlines still under-detect individual corners; accepted cases remain in the shrink-only track gap register.
- Click-to-real-value setup mappings remain unverified for clamping and control availability. See [per-car setup ranges](../project-status/per-car-setup-ranges.md).

### Assetto Corsa

- Reads the AC v1.7 shared-memory layout (`acs.exe`). Brake temperature, slip ratio, slip angle, tyre wear, and brake-pad data are not published, so those analyses are unavailable.
- AC has no lap-validity flag. RaceIQ marks a lap invalid for track limits when more than two tyres are off track for consecutive frames outside the pit lane.
- Cars are registered from their content folder name on first sight; only Kunos tracks in the bundled catalog resolve to named layouts and shared track metadata.
- No Driver profile, Setup Engineer experiment, or setup/tune-library route.

### iRacing

- No Driver profile, Setup Engineer experiment, or setup/tune-library route.
- No stable world-space racing line from the live SDK. Track analysis uses authoritative lap distance and native sector starts instead.
- No continuous per-wheel rotation, slip ratio, slip angle, or tyre-force channels for the corresponding analysis views.
- Tyre temperature and health are pit snapshots; tyre pressure is a static cold setup value.
- RaceIQ reads setup and session identity but does not write garage setup values back to iRacing.

## Cross-game source differences

- iRacing is the only adapter with authoritative native sector starts. Other adapters use RaceIQ sector and track-curation paths.
- F1 and ACC explicitly mark surface analysis unavailable. iRacing supplies vehicle-level surface state rather than per-wheel surface state.
- Weather freshness differs where available: F1 is continuous and AC Evo is static. Field-level support for every game belongs in the generated [telemetry compatibility matrix](../../shared/telemetry/catalog/generated/telemetry-catalog-matrix.md).

Update this page when route capability guards or high-level adapter semantics change. Update generated telemetry artifacts instead when parser field coverage changes.
